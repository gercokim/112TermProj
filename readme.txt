The project is named Portal Runner. It is a side-scrolling platformer taking place in the Portal City, 
a steampunk world relying on portal technology. The user plays as a fugitive who stole a valuable device from the 
government - one that grants the holder the power of teleportation. To win the game, the user must traverse 2 randomly 
generated levels of the Portal City, and in each level collect the parts necessary to unlock the teleporting device and 
jump on every platform. Make sure to avoid the city guards and make use of other power ups.
